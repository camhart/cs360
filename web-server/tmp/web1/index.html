Here at oldstylewebdesign we believe that the current fads in web design have gotten out of control.
<br><br>
<img src="./index_files/arrow002.gif">You don't need java and ajax and php and databases to create and informational and asthetically pleasing
website. All this accomplishes is making your site more complicated and more prone to crashing when
a surge of traffic comes your way. 
<br><br>
<img src="./index_files/arrow002.gif">
How many times have you been linked to a site only to see that there
is a wordpress error because it couldn't handle all of the hits? Many would say that you should get
a better web server, but that's like saying that in order to make my car go faster that I need a bigger
engine. That is one solution. 
<br><br>
<img src="./index_files/arrow002.gif">Another is just to make it more efficient. If all you have on
your site is information, then all you need is straight html. This will handle all of your text loading
as well as give you many options like putting some jazzy pictures or gifs to make it more pleasing to the
eye. All the colors of the rainbow and more are available, why would you want to go all web 2.0 just 
to get your information out onto the information superhighway? 

<br><br>
<img src="./index_files/arrow002.gif">You don't need a Jaguar just to get to 
the end of the block, sometimes all you need is a Yugo. 
<br><br>

Plus, when you go with oldstylewebdesign, you get that retro look which is coming back in a big way.

Plus, here at oldstylewebdesign, we give itemized pricing up front, so you can get a general idea of
what it's going to cost you. No cryptic quotes which could cost you hundreds in hidden pricing down
the road.
